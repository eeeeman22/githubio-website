      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p>
        Thanks for coming here! My name is Ian, I'm a Software Engineer and
        Saxophonist from Long Island. My focus is on building full stack
        applications using Javascript, React, Redux, Node.JS, SQL and NoSQL
        databases, and Docker. In addition to coding, I also play the Saxophone!
        Feel free to check out some of the projects I've worked on, or some of
        my recital recordings.
      </p>
      <p>Cheers, </p>
